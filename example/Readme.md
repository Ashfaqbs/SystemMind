```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Tool Call Sequencing

**Recommended order for general diagnostics:**
```
1. initialize_os_connection      (Always first)
2. get_performance_summary       (Quick overview)
3. get_system_overview           (If more detail needed)
4. diagnose_slow_performance     (If issues detected)
5. Targeted tools based on findings
```

### 2. AI Communication Patterns

**Do:**
- Explain what you're checking before calling tools
- Summarize findings in user-friendly language
- Provide context for technical metrics
- Offer actionable recommendations
- Ask follow-up questions when needed

**Don't:**
- Dump raw tool output without explanation
- Use technical jargon without clarification
- Make assumptions without verification
- Recommend destructive actions without confirmation

### 3. Example Conversation Flow

```
User: "My laptop feels slow"

AI: "I'll help you diagnose the issue. Let me check your system..."

[Calls initialize_os_connection]
[Calls get_performance_summary]

AI: "I've completed the initial check. Your system shows:
     - CPU usage is normal at 15%
     - Memory usage is a bit high at 78%
     - 45 programs are running
     
     The high memory usage might be causing the slowness.
     Let me see what's using the most memory..."

[Calls get_running_processes with limit=10]

AI: "I found the issue! Chrome is using 2.5 GB of RAM across
     multiple processes. This is likely from having many tabs open.
     
     Recommendations:
     1. Close unused Chrome tabs
     2. Restart Chrome to free memory
     3. Consider using a tab manager extension
     
     Would you like me to check anything else?"
```

### 4. Error Handling Strategies

**When tools fail:**
```python
# AI should gracefully handle errors
if tool_returns_error:
    - Acknowledge the issue
    - Explain possible causes
    - Suggest alternatives
    - Don't expose technical stack traces to user
```

**Example:**
```
Tool: "‚ùå Error: Permission denied"

AI: "I wasn't able to access that information due to permission 
     restrictions. This is normal for some system files. 
     
     Would you like me to:
     1. Try checking a different directory?
     2. Provide instructions for running with admin rights?
     3. Check other aspects of your system instead?"
```

---

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Resolutions

#### 1. "Please run 'initialize_os_connection' first"
**Cause:** Tool called before initialization  
**Resolution:** Always call `initialize_os_connection` first

#### 2. "No result received from client-side tool execution"
**Cause:** Tool timeout or crash  
**Resolution:** 
- May need to adjust scan parameters (for find_large_files)
- Check if directory has permission issues
- Try with smaller scope

#### 3. Permission Errors
**Cause:** Insufficient access rights  
**Resolution:**
- Inform user about permission limitations
- Suggest alternative directories
- Explain that some system areas are restricted

#### 4. Platform-Specific Limitations
**Cause:** Feature not available on current OS  
**Example:** Temperature monitoring on Windows  
**Resolution:**
- Acknowledge limitation
- Explain why (OS doesn't expose this data)
- Suggest alternatives if available
